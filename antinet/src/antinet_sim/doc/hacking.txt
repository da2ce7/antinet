Use the allegro helper/wrapper functions from c_allegromisc.hpp ; e.g. alex_* functions.
For singletons use std::call_once and std::once_flag.

Do not use global objects, instead very limited special cases like debugging maybe;
Instead allow objects to store references/pointers to needed tools,
or pass around a variable "contaxt" meta object with needed tools like GUI etc.
