Read all of this in order to properly edit code,
using our Coding Style.

=== Comments ===

Comments are in English.
Write in doxygen style.

=== Tabs, spaces, binary ===

Edit the files style_*cpp and write identical code in them and confirm with program:
./check_style.sh that their binary content (and spaces/tabs) are identical as expected.

Recommended vim settings are in file vimrc here (maybe copy to ~/.vimrc after checking it).

Use unix \n line endings.
Do not put in BOM markers.

=== Allegro ===


Use the allegro helper/wrapper functions from c_allegromisc.hpp ; e.g. alex_* functions.
For singletons use std::call_once and std::once_flag.

=== Variables scope ===

Do not use global objects, instead very limited special cases like debugging maybe;
Instead allow objects to store references/pointers to needed tools,
or pass around a variable "contaxt" meta object with needed tools like GUI etc.
