U --- A --- B ---> C ---> T

U asks A: what is the price (of you making sure packet p reaches node T)
A asks B: what is the price (of same)
B asks C: what is the price (of same)

C offers to B: price 10
B offers to A: price 20
A offers to U: price 30

U chooses A

signatures can be published and are a proof for everyone.

U signs (to A): I will pay you 30 if I get confirmation form T that he got packet p
A signs (to B): I will pay you 20 if I get confirmation form T ...
B signs (to C): I will pay you 10 if I get confirmation form T ...

(T signs to C: that it will sign confirmations of received packets)

U sends p to A
A sends p to B
B sends p to C
C sends p to T

T signs recipient "w" that it got the packet p, sends to C
what if not: C can use arbiters to deliver p to T while getting back confirmation w or to have them as witness that T does not sign

C sends the w to B
therefore B should pay now.
if B does not pay then we can call extra arbiters.
With chainsigned-tokens as the payment system,
arbiber can not do anything to harm the security of the token
(e.g. can not steal it to double spend it).
The coin is already signed by B as a coin that is given by B to C.
(or B is bad guy and we now get witnesses of that).
B has ballance -30

B sends the w to A,
A pays 20 to B (as above).
A has ballance -20

A sends to U,
U pays to A 30.
So A ends up with -20+30 = 10 profit as he wanted.
