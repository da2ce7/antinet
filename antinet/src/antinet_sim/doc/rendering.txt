We always support Allegro (later this will be option).
We use it in version Allegro 4.4 for now.
It uses flat layers.
For all layers: draw each object using ::draw() and it will draw the current layer e.g. just the highlight or the object or the labels etc.


We can support OpenGL. 
We use it with AllegroGL (4.4) and Allegro 4.4 for the toolkit (window creation, and input keyboard/mouse, and loading textures, fonts).
It uses flat layers for now, like in pure Allegro.
For all layers: draw each object using ::draw() and it will draw the current layer e.g. just the highlight or the object or the labels etc.





In future we might use full objects, with Z-testing etc. And Z-sorting for transparency.
